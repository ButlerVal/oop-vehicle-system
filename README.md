        OOP-Vehicle-System
explored concepts such as inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism in this project.
All classes inherit from a base class (Super Class) but overide the abstract method in the super class to
new methods unique to themselves.
Instances of the class are made in the main.py folder and are called in a fuction "main" 
which is called in the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
This allows the program to be run as a script or imported as a module without executing the main function immediately.
This project is a simple OOP vehicle system that demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming.
It includes a base class for vehicles and subclasses for specific types of vehicles, each with unique attributes  
and methods. The system allows for the creation of different vehicle objects and demonstrates how they can be used in a program.
The project is structured to allow for easy expansion and modification, making it a good starting point for learning OOP concepts and testing the functionality of the vehicle system.
